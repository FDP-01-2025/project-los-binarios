# 🎮 C++ Project – *Misko Jhones: The Missing Ol Koi*

---

## 🧠 Project Description

*Misko Jhones: The Missing Ol Koi* is a terminal-style RPG developed in C++. It tells the absurd and chaotic story of **Misko**, a UCA law student who falls asleep in the Magna and is awakened by a mysterious security guard. The security threatens to blow up the university unless Misko retrieves the legendary artifact known as the **OL KOI** — a device with the power to reset the universe.

What follows is a wild and hilarious journey filled with unexpected challenges: dodging living statues, bargaining with Satan, racing electric buses, and battling corrupted AI... all with wooden equipment and a whole lot of bad luck.
